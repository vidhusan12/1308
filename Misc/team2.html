<h2>Ethical reflections and recommendations </h2>

<h4><em>I believe that electric vehicles are the future and would greatly help the planet. The sources for electric vehicles are plentiful. I think that this presentation was a good learning experience and helped my understanding about the environment .  I recommend most people should start using more eco-friendly vehicles due to the fact that the earth is in a state of global warming. With the rise of more eco-friendly technology coming out it should be easier for people to switch to. Eventually gasoline and other oils will run out and will not be able to be manufactured.  Electric vehicles could be a little bit too costly for most people right now, due to them being popular and more of a fashion trend than a reliable source of transport. The more time goes on more and more companies will start jumping on the electric vehicle craze and the prices will start to drop and make it a lot more accessible to those who want one.  Owning electric vehicles could lead to a lot more cool technology being made and have a lot of cool features that I look forward to. I picture a future with everyone riding in self driving cars and not having to pick up food but have it delivered by self driving vehicles and an eco friendly environment. The more the planet changes so do we, as humans we come together and find a way to adapt to the world's climate, by challenging ourselves with almost impossible tasks. By taking more risks we are only bettering ourselves and serving the planet. As long as we are able to think outside the box and think for the future we will be able to reach heights we didn't believe we could reach. Technology might have caused us harm but we can also use it to create and prevent disaster. </em></h4><br>
