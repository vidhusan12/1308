<h2>My personal opinion on Electric cars and i prefer </h2>
<h4><em>Now, I'm not so sure about electric automobiles. They require electricity to function. And the energy does not appear out of nowhere. Assume that all of our automobiles were to transform into electric vehicles overnight. There aren't enough power plants to keep them charged. Actually, even if all of the planet's power plants were redirected to give electricity to vehicles, it would still be insufficient. As a result, we must construct more power plants. Much, much more. What could they possibly be?</em></h4><br>
<h4><em>Regular coal or hydrocarbon-burning power plants (natural gas, oil and its products). So, we still have glasshouse gas pollution; we've simply moved it from billions of automobiles to tens of thousands of power plants. The overall sum will be close to the same.</em></h4><br>
<h4><em>Plants that produce nuclear energy. Okay, the safety problem isn't that serious; we can deal with it. The difficult element is deciding how to dispose of radioactive material.</em></h4><br>
<h4><em>Turbines that generate electricity. To generate enough energy, you'll need a lot of them. They're also pricey. We also have no control over the wind.</em></h4><br>
<h4><em>The sun is a renewable energy source. At sea level, the sun produces around 1000 Watts of energy per square metre. The equator is where you will find yourself. It's daytime. You'll never obtain anything more, no matter how hard you try. Due to the night, clouds, and light falling horizontally rather than vertically, much, much less is seen. You can only achieve so much by erecting massive solar panels fields.</em></h4><br>
<h4><em>Geothermal and marine energy are two types of renewable energy. The sources aren't in the normal places for automobiles to run. And transferring energy over a great distance increases the cost. Those power sources aren't going to provide much in the first place.</em></h4><br>
<h4><em>Electric vehicles can have additional issues (infrastructure and accumulation, for example). There are some suggestions on how to address problems, but I have yet to see any meaningful progress in this area (sure, I am aware of Tesla motors and charging stations all over the place, but that is insufficient to persuade me). The whole thing appears to be a massive public relations stunt. Creating an electric vehicle is not difficult. Why not add individual vehicles? The electric engine has been around for almost a century, and electric trains have been transporting passengers and freight for as long as anybody can remember. Where to get energy for this is the difficult part. That is the problem we must address, as it is required not just for electric vehicles but also for a variety of other difficulties. Overall I'm not a big fan of electric cars. I prefer a normal gasoline car.</em></h4><br>
