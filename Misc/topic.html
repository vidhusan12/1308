<h1>TECHNOLOGY HELPING THE ENVIRONMENT.</h1>


</ul><h5><p>The topic that we chose is how technology helps the environment. Even though technology and the world are on opposite sides of the continuum, people are searching for opportunities to use technology to save the environment more and more every day. Actions like producing sustainable green electricity or using electric vehicles to reduce carbon emission are some examples of our topic. AI and many other tech innovations are also assisting us in creating a more advanced world.  </p></h5>

</ul><h5><p>Some of these types of technology are natural based power supplies which helps us sustain eco-friendly power, and the others help us preserve the earth by causing less damage to the environment. </p></h5>

</ul><h5><p>The most know environmental advantages of technology includes solar panels, wind turbines, and water turbines. Modern environmental technology has allowed us to harness this natural energy and turn it into electricity or reusable heat, proving a strongly beneficial effect on the environment. Although there are disadvantages of using technology. It can be harmful to the environment too due to pollution. Manufacturing and utilizing tech can pollute the air, water, heat, and noise. Waste manufacturing equipment generates a lot of waste because when computers and appliances fail or become obsolete, they are tossed out.</p></h5>
