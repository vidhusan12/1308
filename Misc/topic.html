<h1>TECHNOLOGY HELPING THE ENVIRONMENT.</h1>

</ul><h4>• AI<p></p></h4>

</ul><h4>• Solar panel<p></p></h4>

</ul><h4>• Renewable energy technology<p></p></h4>


</ul><h5><p>The topic that we chose is how Technology helps the environment. Despite the fact that technology and the world are considered to be on opposite sides of the continuum, people are searching for opportunities to use technology to save the environment, so whether it’s producing sustainable green electricity or using electric vehicles to reduce carbon emission, AI and many are assisting us in creating a more prosperous world. </p></h5>

</ul><h5><p>Some of these types of technology are natural based power supplies which help us sustain eco friendly power. And the others help us preserve the earth by causing less damage to the earth.</p></h5>

</ul><h5><p>The biggest environmental advantage of technology is using technologies such as solar panels, wind turbines, and water turbines. Modern environmental technology has allowed us to harness this natural energy and turn it into electricity or usable heat, demonstrating a strongly beneficial effect of technology on the environment but there are disadvantages of using technology. Technology can be harmful to the environment like pollution. Manufacturing and utilising technologies can pollute the air, water, heat, and noise. Waste manufacturing equipment generates a lot of waste because when computers and appliances fail or become obsolete, they are tossed out.</p></h5>
