</ul><h4>• Electric vehicles <p></p></h4>
</ul><h4>• Future development of electric vehicles.<p></p></h4>
</ul><h4>• What direction are electric vehicles heading?<p></p></h4>
</ul><h4>• What other electric vehicles will be useful?<p></p></h4>
</ul><h4>• Does autonomous driving change anything?<p></p></h4>

</ul><h4>We can only hope that electric vehicles become more mainstream as the world could very highly benefit from it. Lowering gas emissions would be the best thing for the planet right now considering the world's current climate. Electric vehicles are becoming more and more accessible and are being marketed in different areas like trucks and trains. What other direction could electric vehicles turn too, planes? <p></p></h4>
</ul><h4>Mostly electric cars are being made by most manufacturers to help society to become most accustomed to them, electric trucks and vans are becoming the focus of most manufactures. <p></p></h4>
</ul><h4>Also  a lot more luxury electric vehicles are being made to cater those with more expensive taste. Uber and ride hailing companies help with lowering gas emissions, lowering the number of traffic on the road and a good way to create customer relations. Uber and other ride hailing companies are a one billion dollar company, earning many members and being able to create future innovations. Uber is now working on making self-driving hovercrafts, which are basically self driving planes but more to that of a drone.  Uber elevate was announced in december 2020 making headlines everywhere, uber elevate is supposed to integrate ground and air travel seamlessly. The hovercraft would only be operated by electric motors much like a tesla vehicle. The blades of the craft would be controlled by said electric motors and produce zero gas emissions. The vehicle is said to be able to take out vertically and travel with a range of 150 miles and a top speed of 200 miles per hour. Uber is partnering with Joby Aviation to create this large feat in technology.  The zero emission aircraft can house four passengers and a pilot. They have not made self driving aircrafts but there has been a decision of the possibility of it happening in the future.  Japan's electric trains are one of the best means of transport in japan. The seer speed of the trains had earned them the nickname of bullet trains.
	These bullet trains are capable of incredible speeds going even faster than F-16 Fighter jets. Japan's new electric trains can go up to speeds of 4800 kilometers per hour. This bullet train is four times faster than an aircraft and two times faster than the F-16 fighter jet. Bullet trains are incredibly efficient, taking only ten minutes to reach Tokyo from Osaka which is 515 kilometers apart. The original Lo series maglev was a gas turbine generator that  powered the air conditioning and lighting. The train uses coils installed in the train along the tracks allowing the train to generate electricity. The maglev would generate electricity the same as a wireless smartphone charger would, this is called inductive charging. Thanks to this technology it reduces the amount of damage caused to the tracks. Maglev uses magnetic repulsion to lift the train and cars off the track. The word maglev is a combination of magnetic and levitation. The magnetic levitation or floating is achieved by an electrodynamic suspension system or EDS. Electric trains are powered by internal electric motors which supply zero carbon emission.Thanks to the movement of clean energy these trains have a very low impact on the environment.  The international energy agency says the rails carry 8% of the world's passengers and 7% of freight and that high-speed services over long distances constitute an eco-friendly alternative to short-distance air travel by reducing emissions.

</ul><h4>Electric buses have been surfacing since 2019. Growth over the past year has been staggering, increasing the electric bus fleets from 1,289 buses. These buses have a low gas emission rating helping the environment by sustaining low costs. More and more of these buses are being used in our streets creating a safer and less polluted earth. We are starting to spread the use of buses all over New zealand now and it's making great feats in transport. Not only are they faster and easy to use but better for our environment. <p></p></h4>
</ul><h4>Electric boats are now making their waves. We have seen more boats being powered by electric motors for smaller boats. We are seeing smaller waves of electric cargo ships being made. A company named port-liner is building their own fully electric cargo ship. Most of these electric cargo ships only sail inland, being able to travel for 34 hours on one full charge.  Is this type of electric vehicle feasible, ranging from cruise ships to ice breakers even warships can all be powered by electric power. Electric propulsion can improve operations in a sensitive environment. Most cargo ships are fueled by bunker fuel also known as heavy fuel oil which contain higher sulphur levels than diesel. Nearly all cargo ships run on combustion engines, letting out a lot of gas emissions. Cargo ships are just about everywhere, all around Asia and the earth. The containers on the cargo ships hold the batteries that power other parts of the vehicle. Load the ship with today’s best commercial Li-ion batteries (300 Wh/kg) and still it would have to carry about 100,000 metric tons of them to go nonstop from Asia to Europe in 31 days. Those batteries alone would take up about 40 percent of maximum cargo capacity, an economically ruinous proposition, never mind the difficulties involved in charging and operating the ship. And even if we push batteries to an energy density of 500 Wh/kg sooner than might be expected, an 18,000-TEU vessel would still need nearly 60,000 metric tons of them for a long intercontinental voyage at a relatively slow speed.  <p></p></h4>
